# FallenWebSiteRP-Design.
Goal of my project:
I created a design for my first serious website, Fallen RP, whose goal is to create a new city with a post-apocalyptic theme in the game Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV) FiveM.

# Resources I used to be able to create it.
This site was created with Html5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

I used html to create the body of my website and create some buttons.

I used CSS to be able to style my website.

I used JavaScript to create a system to configure the volume, advance and reduce the music, using the keyboard keys.
I had a help to be able to create.
